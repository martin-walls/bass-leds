# Bass Guitar LEDs Project

Installed an LED strip around the edge of the body of a bass guitar. LEDs are controlled from an Arduino Nano with several potentiometers and a rotary switch for user controls. A variety of effects are implemented.

Arduino is connected to the guitar pickups via an op-amp, to have sound-reactive effects.
